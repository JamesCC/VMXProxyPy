# Installing on a Raspberry Pi

I have had great success in following the above instructions for a standard Raspberry Pi Linux
install.

This is a very cheap (~Â£30) mini computer which runs Linux.  With a serial port adapter and a USB
power supply it becomes your very own terminal adapter for the V-Mixer.  Unless you buy a WiFi
dongle (or get a Raspberry Pi 3), you will need to connect it to your wireless router via an
Ethernet cable.

The original Raspberry Pi is more than powerful enough, but it has not be tested on this platform.
The limitations will be support of the Raspbian image (which I believe is supported).

There should be no issue running on a Raspberry Pi 2 or 3.

See <http://www.raspberrypi.org/> for more info.  Ethernet is just plug and play (if you're happy
with DHCP), but otherwise setting up networking is beyond the scope of this readme (but there is
plenty of guidance on the website for you).


## Overview

I've provided a lot of detail down here, but it shouldn't be complicated, nor take too long.

If you follow the instructions you shouldn't need a keyboard, monitor or mouse for the
raspberry pi.

Steps:

- Download RASPBIAN STRETCH LITE image
- Install on SD Card using Etcher (windows tool)
- Setup ssh to work on first boot
- (optiona) setup WiFi
- Power up and Boot the Pi
- Install a (free) network scanner to find your Pi (the IP address)
- Log on using ssh via a (free) application called Putty
- Execute a few commands
- Alter a few files with your settings
- Execute a few more commands

Job done.


## Downloading the Raspbian image

I've used RASPBIAN STRETCH LITE successfully <https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/>
(non desktop and the smallest download), but any version of raspbian should be okay.

- <https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/>

I use Etcher to create SD image - <https://etcher.io/>

- Used 8GB SD Card (but only 2G is needed)


## Enable SSH

Before you boot for the first time, add the following file to the SD Card

- `ssh`  (no extension, empty file)

This will enable SSH on first boot.


## Enabling Wifi

This can be done in advance of first boot by placing another file on the created SD Card.  If you
want to use WiFi and you're using STETCH LITE you'll probably want to do this step as you don't
have a nice GUI to set this up later.

- `wpa_supplicant.conf`  (with you wifi credentials and config)

See https://www.e-tinkers.com/2017/03/boot-raspberry-pi-with-wifi-on-first-boot/


## First boot

Once that is in place, boot it, and you can just follow the instructions for Linux above to
install and get a service running (you won't need to install git or python as they will already
be installed).

The Raspberry Pi boots within 20 seconds, and needs no user interaction, so can be boxed and left
to be powered up and down with the mixer.


## Install a network scanner on your phone.

Once booted you'll need to know the Raspberry Pi's IP address.  There are helpful (free) Android
apps that can search the network for you.

- [Network Analyzer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.techet.netanalyzerlite.an)
- [Fing](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.overlook.android.fing)

I recommend Network Analyzer (Net Analyzer).

To Scan your network:

- Click triple bar menu top left
- select `LAN Scan`
- select `Scan`
- wait for ~30 seconds
- look down the list until you find "Raspberry Pi Foundation" (raspberrypi).  There is its
  IP address.


## Install VMXProxy

Download [Putty](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html), an SSH client
that will let you execute commands on the Raspberry Pi.

- Start Putty
- Make sure the connection type is SSH (Port 22)
- In the "Host Name" enter the IP address you found above
- Click Open

Enter in the username `pi`, and the password `raspbian`.

First thing you should do is *Change the password!*  Do this by typing:

    passwd

(entering in the old password `raspbian` and then your new password)

The Raspberry Pi is a Linux device, so now follow the instructions for installing on a
[Linux](install_linux.md).


### Upgrading

In practice VMXProxy is fairly stable, and only the upgrades in last 3 years is the support of
Python 3, addition of a GUI for windows users, and updates on notes for installations.  There has
been no new features affecting the server itself, as the Android App manages most of the
functionality.

Updating is the same as in [Linux](install_linux.md).

Just use Putty again to connect using SSH (and you're new password).  This can be done in situ, as
you don't need a screen to do it, and you could even get an SSH client (to replace putty) for your
phone.
